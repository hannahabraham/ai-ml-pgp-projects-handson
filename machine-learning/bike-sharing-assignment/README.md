# Bike Sharing Assignment
BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing service, is experiencing a revenue decline due to the COVID-19 pandemic and seeks to understand the factors affecting bike demand to prepare for post-lockdown recovery. They aim to identify significant variables influencing bike demand using a multiple linear regression model, leveraging daily demand data and various independent variables. The model will help BoomBikes adjust their business strategy to meet customer expectations and capitalize on market dynamics.
