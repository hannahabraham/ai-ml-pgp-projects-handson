## General Information
 
### Background
A consumer finance company specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile.

### Business Problem
The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. 
The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about past loan applicants and their repayment status. 


## Conclusions
The below listed factors contribute to high risk level 
- Higher loan amount (>16K ), Higher Interest rate (>13%), Low income group (below 37K) 
- Repayment terms (>60 Month), purpose for which the loan is availed (small business, renewable energy, educational)
- Applicants with derogatory public records (1 or 2) or Bankruptcy records (1 or 2)

Considering the above listed risk factors, the below listed suggestions can be considered by the lending club
- Perform additional checks of the applicant 
- Suggest joint application with lower risk applicant
- Reduce the loan amount
- Reduce the term
- Decline the loan
