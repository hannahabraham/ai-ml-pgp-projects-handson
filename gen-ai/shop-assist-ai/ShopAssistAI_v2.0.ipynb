    "# Shop Assist 2.0\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Background\n",
    "In today's digital age, online shopping has become the go-to option for many consumers. However, the overwhelming number of choices and the lack of personalized assistance can make the shopping experience daunting. To address this, we have developed ShopAssist AI, a chatbot that combines the power of large language models and rule-based functions to ensure accurate and reliable information delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a dataset containing information about laptops (product names, specifications, descriptions, etc.), build a chatbot that parses the dataset and provides accurate laptop recommendations based on user requirements.By integrating **Function Calling API**, the system enhances response accuracy, streamlines interactions, and improves overall user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges\n",
    "-  **Complex Multi-layered System** – Managing multiple layers for seamless chatbot interactions was complex.\n",
    "-  **Inconsistent JSON Format** – Ensuring structured JSON output required multiple validation layers.\n",
    "-  **Loss of Context** – Separate LLM instances for user info extraction and product recommendation led to lost context.\n",
    "-  **Misclassifications** – Despite rule-based frameworks, laptop specifications were often misclassified.\n",
    "-  **Limited Rule Framework** – The existing rules for classifying laptop specifications were not exhaustive.\n",
    "-  **Lack of Intent Recall** – If user intent changed, there was no seamless way to recall product extraction.\n",
    "-  **Rigid Workflow** – The system lacked flexibility to adapt to user preference shifts dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Enhanced System Design\n",
    "-  **Function Calling API for User Requirements** – The chatbot now extracts user needs dynamically within a single conversation and outputs structured JSON for recommendation processing.\n",
    "-  **Unified LLM for User Interaction & Recommendation** – A single LLM instance now handles both user conversations and recommendations, retaining context for more personalized results.\n",
    "-  **Improved Context Retention** – Combining prompts for requirement extraction and recommendations improves continuity and personalization.\n",
    "-  **More Flexible & Scalable Architecture** – The system can now be easily extended for different product domains with minimal modifications."
